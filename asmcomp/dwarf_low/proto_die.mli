(* A "proto-DIE" contains similar information to a DWARF debugging
   information entry (DIE), but contains the actual attributes whose values
   are being specified, rather than linking to them via an abbrevation
   code.  The abbreviation codes are assigned later, when the proto-DIEs
   are turned into DIEs.
   Proto-DIEs may be formed into the required tree structures using a
   simple parenting relationship.  The complexities of flattening the
   structure to the DWARF representation (Section 2.3, DWARF-4 spec) are
   hidden. *)

   [`End_of_siblings] indicates that a chain of siblings---that is to say,
   proto-DIEs with the same parent and at the same tree depth as each other---
   has finished.  This should correspond exactly to the points at which a
   "chain of sibling entries [must be] terminated by a null entry" specified
   in the DWARF-4 spec.
