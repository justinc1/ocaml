(* [available_regs ~instr ~avail_before] calculates, given the registers
   "available before" an instruction [instr], the registers that are available
   after [instr].  This is a forwards dataflow analysis.

   "available before" can be thought of, at the assembly level, as the set of
   registers available when the program counter is equal to the address of the
   particular instruction under consideration (that is to say, immediately
   prior to the instruction being executed).  Inputs to that instruction are
   available at this point even if the instruction will clobber them.  Results
   from the previous instruction are also available at this point.

   The [available_before] field of each instruction is updated by this
   function to the subset of the [avail_before] argument consisting of those
   registers that are tagged with identifier names, and are not related to special
   parameters such as environments for mutually-recursive closures.  (The rationale is
   that these are the registers we may be interested in referencing, by name, when
   debugging.)
