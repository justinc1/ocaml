Note: only the AMD64/unix has had a significant amount of testing.


sparc: save the requested size in %g2, [caml_call_gc] uses it to
       recover the old value of [caml_young_ptr].

i386:  do not write back [caml_young_ptr] in the "gc" branch, only in
       the "allocation success" branch.

power: same as i386: do not adjust the allocation register in the GC branch

ARM:   adjust the pointer back to its initial value before calling
       [caml_call_gc].

ARM64: same as ARM

AMD64_nt: same as ARM
