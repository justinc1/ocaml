]

(* [where_was_value_allocated v] attempts to determine the source
   location at which the value [v] was allocated.  If the source location
   cannot be determined, but the virtual memory address of the allocation
   point is known, that address will be returned instead.  The location
   of some values may be completely unknown.  If [v] is not a boxed
   (allocated) value then [`Not_boxed] will be returned.

   This function can resolve source locations even for values allocated
   outside OCaml code (for example in C bindings).

   Upon the first call to this function it will block for a short time
   whilst it reads part of the current program's executable from disk.
   The executable should not be changed on disk whilst the program is
   running if it makes use of this function.

   This function is thread safe, although, if it is called from another
   thread whilst in progress reading the executable file then it may
   return [`At_address] instead of [`At_source_location] or
   [`Between_source_locations] during that period.

   [where_was_value_allocated], except that it does not access the
   program's executable on disk, and does not resolve addresses to
   source locations.  It runs in (short) constant time.  It is
   thread safe. *)

     accompanied by the usual associated slice of major collection.

  (* [dump_allocators_of_major_heap_blocks] writes a file that may be
     decoded using tools/allocation-profiling/decode-major-heap.sh
     in order to show, for each block in the major heap, where it was
     allocated.  For example:
       decode-major-heap.sh profile-output-file executable-file

  (* [dump_heapgraph] writes two files that may be decoded using
     tools/allocation-profiling/decode-heapgraph.sh in order to show
     the graph of values in the heap quotiented by the equivalence
     relation that identifies two values iff they were allocated at
     the same source location.  This enables judgements such as
     "a lot of values were allocated at foo.ml line 36 and they were
     pointed at by values allocated at bar.ml line 42".

  (* [forget_where_values_were_allocated] erases allocation profiling
     information on all values.  This is useful at the start of some
     benchmarking period---for example to exclude allocations associated
     with one-time startup costs from a profile.

     This function does not just affect the results of the functions
     in this [Heap_snapshot] module; it also affects the results of
     [where_was_value_allocated], etc, above.  It does not however
     affect the functions in the [Global] module below.

     profiling information rather than working on current snapshots
     of the heap.

  (* [dump_allocations_by_address] writes a file that may be decoded
     using tools/allocation-profiling/decode-by-address.sh in order
     to show the total number of values and words allocated at each
     program source location.  These counts will increment from the
     start of the program unless the reset function, below, is
     called.  Example script invocation:
       decode-by-address.sh profile-output-file executable-file
  *)
