(** Profiling of a program's space behaviour over time.
    Currently only supported on x86-64 platforms running 64-bit code.

    This module may only be used when the -spacetime option was passed
    to the configure script for the compiler being used.

    For functions to decode the information recorded by the profiler,
    see the Spacetime offline library in otherlibs/. *)

module Series : sig

  (** Type representing a file that will hold a series of heap snapshots
      together with additional information required to interpret those
      snapshots. *)
  type t

  (** [create ~path] creates a series file at [path]. *)
  val create : path:string -> t

  (** [save_and_close series] writes information into [series] required for
      interpeting the snapshots that [series] contains and then closes the
      [series] file. This function must be called to produce a valid series
      file. *)

module Snapshot : sig
  (** [take series] takes a snapshot of the profiling annotations on the values
      in the minor and major heaps, together with GC stats, and write the
      result to the [series] file.  This function triggers a minor GC but only
      allocates a very small amount of memory itself. *)
