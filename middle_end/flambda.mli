  (** During the lifting of [let] bindings to [program] constructions after
      closure conversion, we generate symbols and their corresponding
      definitions (which may or may not be constant), together with field
      accesses to such symbols.  We would like it to be the case that such
      field accesses are simplified to the relevant component of the
      symbol concerned.  (The rationale is to generate efficient code and
      share constants as expected: see e.g. tests/asmcomp/staticalloc.ml.)
      The components of the symbol would be identified by other symbols.
      This sort of access pattern is feasible because the top-level structure
      of symbols is statically allocated and fixed at compile time.
      It may seem that [Prim (Pfield, ...)] expressions could be used to
      perform the field accesses.  However for simplicity, to avoid having to
      keep track of properties of individual fields of blocks,
      [Inconstant_idents] never deems a [Prim (Pfield, ...)] expression to be
      constant.  This would in general prevent field accesses to symbols from
      being simplified in the way we would like, since [Lift_constants] would
      not assign new symbols (i.e. the things we would like to simplify to)
      to the various projections from the symbols in question.
      To circumvent this problem we use [Read_symbol_field] when generating
      projections from the top level of symbols.  Owing to the properties of
      symbols described above, such expressions may be eligible for declaration
      as constant by [Inconstant_idents] (and thus themselves lifted to another
      symbol), without any further complication.
      [Read_symbol_field] may only be used when the definition of the symbol
      is in scope in the [program].  For external unresolved symbols, [Pfield]
      may still be used; it will be changed to [Read_symbol_field] by

(** The representation of a set of function declarations (possibly mutually

    Before a function can be applied it must be "projected" from a set of
    closures to yield a "closure".  This is done using [Project_closure]
    (see above).  Given a closure, not only can it be applied, but information
    about its defining environment can be retrieved (using [Project_var],
    see above).
    At runtime, a [set_of_closures] corresponds to an OCaml value with tag
    [Closure_tag] (possibly with inline [Infix_tag](s)).  As an optimization,
    an operation ([Move_within_set_of_closures]) is provided (see above)

  specialised_args : specialised_to Variable.Map.t;
  (** Parameters whose corresponding arguments are known to always alias a
      particular value.  These are the only parameters that may, during
      [Inline_and_simplify], have non-unknown approximations.

      An argument may only be specialised to a variable in the scope of the
      corresponding set of closures declaration.  Usually, that variable
      itself also appears in the position of the specialised argument at
      all call sites of the function.  However it may also be the case (for
      example in code generated as a result of [Augment_specialised_args])
      that the various call sites of such a function have differing
      variables in the position of the specialised argument.  This is
      permissible *so long as it is certain they all alias the same value*.
      Great care must be taken in transformations that result in this
      situation since there are no invariant checks for correctness.

      As an example, supposing all call sites of f are represented here:
        [let x = ... in
         let f a b c = ... in
         let y = ... in
         f x y 1;
         f x y 1]
      the specialised arguments of f can (but does not necessarily) contain
      the association [a] -> [x], but cannot contain [b] -> [y] because [f]
      is not in the scope of [y]. If f were the recursive function
      [let rec f a b c = f a 1 2 in], [a] -> [x] would still be a valid
      specialised argument because all recursive calls maintain the invariant.

      This information is used for optimization purposes, if such a binding is
      known, it is possible to specialise the body of the function according
      to its parameter. This is usually introduced when specialising a
      recursive function, for instance.
        [let rec map f = function
           | [] -> []
           | h :: t -> f h :: map f t
         let map_succ l =
           let succ x = x + 1 in
           map succ l]
      [map] can be duplicated in [map_succ] to be specialised for the argument
      [f]. This will result in
        [let map_succ l =
           let succ x = x + 1 in
           let rec map f = function
             | [] -> []
             | h :: t -> f h :: map f t in
           map succ l]
      with map having [f] -> [succ] in its [specialised_args] field.

      Specialised argument information for arguments that are used must
      never be erased.  This ensures that specialised arguments whose
      approximations describe closures maintain those approximations, which
      is essential to transport the closure freshening information to the
      point of use (e.g. a [Project_var] from such an argument).

    simplification functions in CPS.  This function provides for the
    rewriting or elimination of expressions during the fold.

    This function preserves phantom lets but does not pass them to the
    user-supplied functions.

    If [filter_defining_expr] requests deletion of a let and we are
    generating debugging information, the let will not be deleted, but
    instead turned into a [Phantom].
